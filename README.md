# Genetic Algorithm: Sudoku Solver

## Description

This project is a Sudoku solver that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to
solve Sudoku puzzles. It is designed to take a Sudoku puzzle as input, apply
genetic algorithm operations, and produce a solution or the best puzzle found.
The genetic algorithm involves creating a population of Sudoku puzzles,
evaluating their fitness, culling less fit puzzles, and generating new
generations until a solution is found or the maximum number of generations is
reached.
