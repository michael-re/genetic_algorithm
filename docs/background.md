# Background

## Learning Goals

* Familiarize yourself with basic design pattern concepts.
* Understand how and when to use standard design patterns in your own software designs.
* Incorporate a set of design patterns into a non-trivial software design.
* Implement and test a set of design patterns as a part of a non-trivial program.
* Learn about and implement a type of randomized algorithm: genetic algorithms.

In this assignment, you will use a variety of object-oriented design patterns to
develop a randomized algorithm to solve a non-trivial problem. Design patterns
are classes and interactions that have proven useful over time, and so have been
more-or-less codified among software professionals. Some are very interesting,
but don't let the "gee-whiz!" of design patterns be the driving force behind
your designs: they are solutions to particular problems. Beware **[`the story of the object-oriented toaster`](https://www.danielsen.com/jokes/objecttoaster.txt)**,
lest you suffer the same fate (or end up building a
**[`$300 two-slice toaster`](https://www.revcook.com)** that only a small number
of software engineers will ever buy).

## The Problem: Solving Sudoku Puzzles

**[`Sudoku`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)** is a type of puzzle that
originated in Japan and attracted a worldwide following, appearing in
newspapers, books, and web sites around the world. It is very simple: a 9-by-9
arrangement of squares, subdivided into 3-by-3 groups. A particular puzzle comes
with a subset of the squares filled in with numbers from 1 through 9. To solve
the puzzle, one must only fill in all the blank squares with numbers from 1
through 9 so that no row, column, or 3-by-3 block in the puzzle has the same
number twice. That's all there is to it!

## Deterministic Algorithms to Solve Sudoku

There are a variety of techniques that can be used to solve sudoku puzzles.
One of the simplest involves the use of what are called pencil marks. In this
approach, each unsolved square in the puzzle is first initialized with a list
of all possible values: the numbers one through nine. Initialization continues:
for each unsolved square, its row, column, and block are scanned. Each time a
square that initially has a number assigned to it is found, that square's number
is eliminated from the unsolved square's pencil marks. Once this process is
done, each unsolved square's initialized pencil marks now contain only those
numbers that are still possible solutions.

Solving the puzzle can now commence by finding squares with only single pencil
marks: these squares must have that value. Setting that value for a square may
change the pencil marks for other squares in its row, column, or block,
hopefully producing more squares with singleton marks. This continues until
either the puzzle is solved or there are no more squares with such forced
values. Unfortunately, only the simplest sudoku puzzles can be solved in this
manner; more sophisticated techniques are necessary for harder puzzles.

## Genetic Algorithms

In this assignment, we will be using a type of randomized algorithm called
**_[`genetic programming`](http://www.genetic-programming.com/gpanimatedtutorial.html)_**
(GA) to solve sudoku puzzles. Randomized algorithms use a non-deterministic
approach to search for problem solutions, coupling randomness with a means for
quickly eliminating possibilities that are likely to be inferior. This may not
be the most efficient strategy to solve sudoku puzzles, but it is illustrative
of the power of such algorithms, in that just about all it requires is a way to
evaluate the quality of a partially solved puzzle to achieve a solution
(eventually). It will be interesting to see how well GA works for this problem.

GA is also an example of a general algorithm that can be implemented
independently of the type of data operated on. You are already familiar with a
simple approach to this, using templates. In this assignment, you will use more
sophisticated OO design patterns to produce abstract descriptions of the basic
operations needed for GA and then develop concrete subclasses of those abstractions.

## Genetic Programming as Simplified Evolution

It is difficult for some people to understand how a process like evolution,
which is primarily viewed as being driven by an underlying random process
(mutation), can produce complex organisms that work so well. However, from a
computational point of view, this is not surprising at all. In fact, the area
of randomized algorithms is a hot topic — these algorithms have been used
successfully to solve many problems for which no deterministic solution exists.
From a computational point of view, evolution is a randomized algorithm.

The basic idea behind any type of problem solving is to generate possible
solutions, evaluate how good they are, and then use that information to generate
what are hopefully better possible solutions. This _optimization_ process is
repeated until either a perfect solution is found, a solution that is
"good enough" is found, or you give up. This is what you do when you try to find
a word in a dictionary. Problems like finding a word in a dictionary are easy to
solve because the error in the possible solution at each step tells you how to
change the solution for the next step. So, we can generate a
_deterministic algorithm_ that solves it.

If we think of the dictionary as a landscape that we're exploring, then it is
like a smooth slope, and all we need to do is go downhill
(like a rolling marble) until we reach the bottom — the word we're looking for.
If we overshoot the word, we've rolled up the hill on the other side, and we
just roll back the way we came. Simple problems have this sort of landscape.

Unfortunately, not all problems are simple. Many have rugged landscapes with
many little "valleys". We don't want to get stuck in a little valley high in the
mountains — we want to reach the lowest valley there is. Clearly, if the terrain
is rough, then we can't use the slope of the terrain as our guide. Instead, we
need to jump around a bit. And this is what randomization does for us: it allows
us to explore the landscape, and it gives us the ability to "mix" the degree of
jumping (how far we jump, how jumps are related to starting point, how "jumpy"
we are at any point in time) and rolling.

So, evolution is a randomized algorithm in the sense that mutation and
recombination change algorithms ("recipes" for organisms) in a random manner
and the resultant solutions are "evaluated" by everyday life, with only the best
(or, at least, "good enough") solutions able to reproduce (be modified for the
next round of optimization).

GA is one way to use an evolution-like process to find optimal algorithms.
GA may in general work on representations of algorithms, but in the context of
this assignment it will work on a representation of a possible sudoku puzzle
solution. A potential sudoku puzzle can simply be a 9-by-9 array of digits,
with all values filled in. Clearly, if you fill in all squares in a puzzle
randomly, it's unlikely you'll have a valid puzzle solution. But this is merely
a starting point.

What makes this approach "genetic" is that a GA program is used that generates
an initial, random _population_ of solutions. In each _generation_, each of the
members of the population have their fitness evaluated, and some fraction of the
best solutions are selected for _reproduction_. These reproducing solutions may
have their underlying representations randomly altered and may have parts of
their representations swapped with other solutions. The result is a new
generation of solutions based on the best of the previous generation.
This process is repeated until the solution reaches some quality threshold or a
maximum number of generations is exceeded.
